    <h2>Why Brain Health Matters</h2>
    <p>Combat sports put incredible stress on the body — and the brain. Repeated head trauma can lead to long-term cognitive damage, emotional instability, and chronic neurological conditions like CTE. Understanding the risks is the first step toward prevention.</p>

    <h2>Preventative Strategies</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <strong>Neck Strengthening:</strong> Stronger neck muscles help absorb and distribute impact forces, reducing head acceleration.
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <strong>Smart Sparring:</strong> Use headgear and track your rounds. Focus on technique, not knockouts.
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <strong>Recovery Time:</strong> Respect concussions. Allow full recovery and follow return-to-sport protocols.
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <strong>Sleep & Nutrition:</strong> Sleep is critical for brain repair. Fuel with omega-3s, hydration, and antioxidants.

    <h2>Personal Story</h2>
    <p>I’m Ryan Safarha, 17 years old, and I trained in MMA six days a week. I sparred often, grappled daily, and competed in BJJ, wrestling, and striking. Despite being young and feeling strong, I developed a chronic subdural hematoma from regular sparring — no knockouts, just repetition. It led to serious symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and the terrifying risk of seizures, strokes, and numbness on one side of my body. Even after stepping back, I’ve seen countless friends — teenagers and adults — who now slur their words, forget conversations, or speak like they’re drunk, all because of unchecked brain trauma.</p>
    <div class="card">
      <strong>What is a Chronic Subdural Hematoma?</strong>
      <p>A chronic subdural hematoma is a slow-bleeding collection of blood between the brain and its outer covering, often caused by repeated minor head trauma. If untreated, it can lead to seizures, strokes, memory loss, confusion, and weakness or numbness on one side of the body. These symptoms may appear gradually and can be life-altering if not addressed promptly.</p>

    <p>“Nick Blackwell went into a coma after a boxing match and never returned to professional fighting. He now advocates for brain injury awareness and safety in the sport.” – <em>Headway UK</em></p>
    <p>“Ronda Rousey shared publicly that she sustained multiple concussions in judo and MMA. Her honesty helped normalize the discussion of head trauma in professional fighting.” – <em>The Guardian</em></p>
    <p>“Georges St-Pierre, one of the greatest MMA fighters, rarely sparred during training to avoid head trauma. His career longevity and mental clarity post-retirement are a testament to the power of smart preparation.” – <em>GSP Interviews</em></p>
