    <h2>Common Myths About Head Trauma</h2>

    <div class="myth">
      <strong>Myth:</strong> “Headgear protects you from concussions.”
      <p><em>Reality:</em> Studies show that while headgear can reduce cuts and superficial trauma, it does not significantly prevent concussions. Concussions are caused by the brain moving inside the skull — headgear doesn’t stop that acceleration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myth">
      <strong>Myth:</strong> “You’re fine as long as you don’t get knocked out.”
      <p><em>Reality:</em> Many fighters suffer brain damage without ever being KO’d. It’s the repeated smaller impacts — especially in sparring — that build up over time and do lasting damage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myth">
      <strong>Myth:</strong> “CTE only happens to pros.”
      <p><em>Reality:</em> CTE has been documented in teenage athletes and amateurs. Duration and frequency of trauma matter more than whether you got paid to compete.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Science-Backed Prevention Methods</h2>

    <div class="method">
      <strong>1. Track Your Sparring:</strong>
      <p>Keep a journal or log of your sparring days, intensity, and any symptoms (headaches, fogginess, mood swings). Patterns can help you recognize early red flags before they become serious.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="method">
      <strong>2. Prioritize Neck Strength:</strong>
      <p>Stronger necks reduce rotational acceleration during impact. Simple exercises like resisted flexion and neck bridges help protect the brain. Research from the Journal of Neurosurgery confirms this link.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="method">
      <strong>3. Take Recovery Seriously:</strong>
      <p>After even mild symptoms, take time off. One study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that returning too early can double recovery time or worsen long-term damage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="method">
      <strong>4. Sleep & Nutrition:</strong>
      <p>The brain recovers during deep sleep. Prioritize at least 8 hours per night, plus omega-3s (like fish oil), antioxidants (like berries), and hydration. These support neuroplasticity and healing.</p>
